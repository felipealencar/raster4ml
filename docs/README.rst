When geospatial raster data is concerned in a machine learning pipeline,
it is often required to extract meaningful features, such as vegetation
indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI, NDRE, etc.) or textures. This package provides
easy-to-use functions that can automatically calculates the features
with one or several lines of codes in Python. It also has the
functionality of extracting statistics based on shapefile (i.e., point
or polygon) from a raster data. Any type of raster data is supported
regardless of satellite or UAVs.

Key Features
============

-  **Stacking Bands:** Stack or combine bands together to form a
   multiband raster data.
-  **Calculate Features:** Automatically calculate necessary vegetation
   indices without providing any formula. Currently the package support
   56 vegetation indices. (More will come)
-  **Extract raster values based on shapefile:** Extract pixel values of
   a given image by a point shapefile or statistics from a given
   polygon. Also has batch-wise processign support for multiple images.
-  **Clip raster based on polygon:** Clip a raster image based on the
   shape of given polygon file.

How to Install?
===============

Dependencies
------------

**Raster4ML** is built on top of
`geopandas <https://geopandas.org/en/stable/>`__,
`rasterio <https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__,
`fiona <https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona>`__,
`pyproj <https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/>`__,
`rtree <https://github.com/Toblerity/rtree>`__,
`shapely <https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html>`__,
`numpy <https://numpy.org/>`__, and
`pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`__.

Virtual Environment
-------------------

It is prefered to use a virtual environment for working with this
package. Use `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`__ or
`Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`__ to create
a seperate environment and then install the package and its dependencies
there.

::

   conda create --name raster4ml python=3
   conda activate raster4ml

Windows
-------

To install on Windows, first download the wheel files for **GDAL**,
**rasterio**, and **fiona** from `Christoph Gohlkeâ€™s
website <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`__ (ðŸ¤—Thanks
ChristophðŸ¤—). Go to his website, press Ctrl+F and type gdal. Download the
GDAL file that mostly matches your computer configuration (64-bit or
32-bit) and Python version.

After downloading it, cd into the downloaded directory while the
raster4ml environment is activated. Then install using pip. Do the same
for **rasterio** and **fiona**.

::

   pip install GDALâ€‘3.4.3â€‘cp310â€‘cp310â€‘win_amd64.whl
   pip install rasterioâ€‘1.2.10â€‘cp310â€‘cp310â€‘win_amd64.whl
   pip install Fionaâ€‘1.8.21â€‘cp310â€‘cp310â€‘win_amd64.whl

If these three are installed, the rest of the dependencies can be
installed directly through **Raster4ML**\ â€™s pip distribution.

::

   pip install raster4ml
